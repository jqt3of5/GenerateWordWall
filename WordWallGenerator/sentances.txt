I love you
I love him
I love her
you love me
you love butts
you love it
you hate it
I hate you
I hate him
I hate her
what do you want
what do you like
do you like tea
do you want coffee
do you like coffee
I really want dinner
I like pizza
I do not like fish
I am reading a book
I am an electrician
I am a nerd
I am cooking dinner
I was here
I went to work
I ate spaghetti for lunch
I want your butt
I want to eat you
when are you coming home
how are you doing
where do you want to go for dinner
my wife really likes babies
who wants to drink
what time is it
what time does the class end
I do not understand
I am sorry
hello husband
hello wife
when do you want to eat
I am the happiest person ever
do you want wine
do you want beer
do you want vodka

he is as mad as a hornet
they sleep in the afternoon
I am taking a break from work
I have something to tell you
breaking glass can make a loud noise
he had pink and green hair
there is one open baby swing
I do not get you
paul gave me a present
we will put you on the list
I am here for you
it was a tough time
I broke my phone
I have bought the car
this is just too big for one person to carry
he is not the sharpest knife in the drawer
please take pity on me
keep it up
how beautiful she is
what do you want me to say

the river flows so fast
I am a fan of american cooking
his eyes were glazed over
wearing bows was her favorite thing to do
tom had a great big grin on his face
the sun comes up in the east
I heard you two had a fight
diamonds are forever
you are the best person I know
I feel like I am going to pass out
tom asked me if he was invited to the party
I owe tom big time
going to the city is a good time to dress up
they are as different as night and day
shape up or ship out
that is right and do not ever forget it
it took quite a while
why does it rain

everything is so expensive
the gorilla beat his chest
kate was surprised when she saw that big dog
you can either stay or leave
I do not like meat
you do not have children
I was dying of boredom at work today
there will be a big earthquake in the future
he drinks more water than I do
bowls can be any color
you as the maker get to decide the design
I love frozen yogurt
it is the biggest sports shop in the region
wearing bows was her favorite thing to do
I will have a baby in the near future
did you eat my leftovers out of the fridge
what is new with you
go home weirdo
are you sure narwhals are real
